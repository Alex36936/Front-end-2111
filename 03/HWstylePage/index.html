       The Fox and The Crane 
    </h1>
    <p>
    <i>
        It was long, long ago when the Fox and the Crane were close friends. One fine day the Fox invited the Crane to dinner with her and said to him:

        <br>«Come,  buddy! Come, my dear! Ill treat you heartily!”
        
        And so the Crane came to the Fox for the dinner party. <b>The Fox had cooked semolina for the dinner and smeared it over the plate. Then she served it and treated her guest.
        
            <br>“Help yourself to tasty dinner, my dear godfather. </b>That was me who cooked it!”
        
        The Crane went peck-peck with his beak, knocked and knocked but couldnt pick even a bit of fare. The Fox kept licking the cereal until she had eaten it all.

    <div>
        <p id="special-text">When theres no cereal at all, the Fox said,
    
    <br>«Dont feel offended, buddy. Theres nothing more to treat you”.
    
    «And thanks hereon, dear,” the Crane said, “now its your turn to visit me”.
    
    <br>Next day the Fox came, and the Crane made okroshka and poured in into a tall pitcher with a narrow neck and treated the fox.
    
    <i>“Help yourself to tasty dinner, my dear godmother. Honestly, theres nothing more to entertain you”.</i>
